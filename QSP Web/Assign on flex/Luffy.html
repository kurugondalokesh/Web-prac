        <p>Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, and dreamt of being a pirate since childhood from the influence of his idol and mentor Red-Haired Shanks. At the age of 17, Luffy sets sail from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as "King of the Pirates".

            He fights antagonists, and aids and befriends the inhabitants of several islands on his journey. Usually cheerful, he becomes serious and even aggressive when he fights. Luffy uses his elasticity to concentrate his power, executing a range of attacks. In his signature attack, Gum-Gum Pistol, he slingshots punches at opponents from a distance. Luffy also grows stronger over the course of the story, as reflected in his "bounty", which is used to measure the threat he poses to the World Government. He is the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, who is a vice-admiral; the son of Monkey D. Dragon, who is the leader of the Revolutionary Army;[10], and sworn brother of Portgas D. Ace and Sabo.[11]</p>
