            Gol D. Roger also known as Gold Roger, is one of the two posthumous overarching protagonists (alongside Joy Boy) of the One Piece franchise and captain of the Roger Pirates. He held the title of Pirate King. He was executed in his hometown Logue Town, leaving the reason he is willing to be executed because of his illness (which cannot be cured). His bounty was 5,564,800,000 Berrie. According to Brannew, his' and his arch foe, Whitebeard's bounties were unsurpassed.
