            After Roger's execution, Rayleigh retired and settled on Sabaody Archipelago. Despite his retirement as a pirate, his bounty wasn't simply forgotten or removed due to pirates carried crimes years ago, especially the Roger Pirates. He met Boa Hancock and her sisters, Sandersonia and Marigold, and helped them to find their way back to Amazon Lily by calling Gloriosa. He pretended to become a slave to steal money to made customers of the Human Auction House cancel orders and demanded refunds. As Luffy and his crew try to escape, Rayleigh holds off Kizaru until Bartholomew Kuma arrived and send the Straw Hats flying toward other islands after he revealed to Rayleigh that he works for the Revolutionary Army as a spy.
